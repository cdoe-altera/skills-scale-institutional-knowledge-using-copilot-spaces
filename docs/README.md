# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

> Reference: [Issue #1](https://github.com/cdoe-altera/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/1)

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Our process spans the complete project lifecycle—from initial problem validation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective—with defined roles, communication cadences, and quality gates at each stage. All projects are managed using cross-functional teams with designated Product Managers who define outcomes and prioritize work, Project Managers who coordinate delivery and manage risks, Developers who implement solutions, and QA/Testing personnel who validate quality. We maintain transparency through consistent documentation artifacts including project charters, roadmaps, backlogs, risk registers, and retrospective notes.

The core workflows follow a five-phase lifecycle: **Initiation** establishes the problem statement, stakeholders, and high-level timeline; **Planning** breaks work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria and estimates; **Execution** involves daily standups, pull request workflows, and continuous integration with automated testing; **Release** includes deployment checklists, smoke tests, and rollback plans; and **Retrospective** captures learnings and converts them into actionable improvements. Throughout execution, teams use project boards (such as GitHub Projects) with workflow states from Backlog through Done, enforce small pull requests with peer review requirements, and maintain CI pipelines that run automated tests, linting, and security scanning.

Communication follows a regular cadence designed to maintain alignment without creating overhead: weekly syncs between Product and Project Managers, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, sprint reviews and demos at iteration boundaries, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks and dependencies are tracked in a structured Risk Register with impact assessment, mitigation plans, and weekly monitoring. Escalation paths are clearly defined, moving from team-level resolution to PM coordination to Product Lead and Sponsor involvement as needed. All communication uses consistent templates for status updates, incident notifications, and decision documentation, ensuring stakeholders have access to accurate, timely information.

Quality assurance is integrated throughout the development process rather than being a final gate. Our approach includes unit tests for new logic, integration tests for component interactions, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning in CI pipelines. Manual QA validates feature acceptance against defined criteria before release. We track metrics including velocity, burndown, and the success indicators identified in each project's charter, using dashboards to monitor key signals such as errors, latency, and usage patterns. Post-release, we conduct blameless retrospectives to identify improvements, prioritize 2–3 actionable items per iteration, and track their implementation to continuously refine our processes.

## Quick Start for New Team Members

1. **Read the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)** to understand our principles and approach
2. **Review [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)** to understand your responsibilities and how you collaborate with others
3. **Familiarize yourself with the lifecycle guides** that apply to your current project phase
4. **Bookmark this README** as your central reference for process documentation

## Key Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments rather than large batches
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named Product and Project Managers with defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless problem-solving
